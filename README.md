# About
One json file containing waypoint presets for various maps, automatically fetched from Rigs of Rods to use with the AI.

Open survey map (TAB) and use right mouse button to set waypoints. Use middle mouse button to remove them. You may also try the `Record`button to record a dense path using the character or a vehicle. Once you are done, click the `Waypoints` header and hit the `Export` button. A notififation will appear and the waypoints will be saved in `RoR.log`.

Open an issue in this repository and provide the terrain name, desired preset name and waypoints list. Pull requests are welcomed also, the json file is very simple structured.
